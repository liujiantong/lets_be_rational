Upgraded to python-3.x

A Python SWIG wrapper for the functions in "Let's Be Rational" by Peter Jäckel.

## About "Let's be Rational":

["Let's Be Rational"](http://www.pjaeckel.webspace.virginmedia.com/LetsBeRational.pdf) is a paper by [Peter Jäckel](http://jaeckel.org) showing *"how Black's volatility can be implied from option prices with as little as two iterations to maximum attainable precision on standard (64 bit floating point) hardware for all possible inputs."*

The paper is accompanied by the full C source code, which resides at [www.jaeckel.org/LetsBeRational.7z](www.jaeckel.org/LetsBeRational.7z).
